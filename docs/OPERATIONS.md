# Operations Architecture

This document defines the durable contract for Maestria's runtime operations, state management, and recovery procedures.

## 1. Bounded Runtime Lifecycle

All tasks, queries, and background jobs operate within a bounded lifecycle:
*   **Initialization:** Resource allocation and context loading.
*   **Execution:** Active processing subject to hard timeouts and resource quotas.
*   **Termination:** Guaranteed cleanup, regardless of success, failure, or cancellation.

## 2. State and Recovery

*   **Journals:** Domain events and effect intents MUST be durably recorded before projections or non-idempotent adapter execution. Projections remain rebuildable.
*   **Recovery:** System restarts or crash recoveries replay the journal and reconcile persisted projections from the last valid checkpoint. In-flight non-idempotent effects pause unless explicitly resumed.
*   **Retries:** Idempotent operations support bounded automated retries with explicit backoff. Non-idempotent operations are not replayed after adapter execution begins without operator approval or a compensating action.

## 3. Execution Control

*   **Cancellation:** All long-running operations MUST be cancellable. Cancellation records a typed outcome, stops work at adapter-defined safe points, and releases resources; already committed external effects are not silently rolled back.
*   **Reproducibility:** Operations relying on stochastic models log model/index fingerprints, configuration, and random seeds where available. Reproducibility claims are bounded by the captured environment and corpus snapshot.

## 4. Data Evolution

*   **Migrations:** Schema changes to journals or persistent stores require explicit, forward-only migration scripts.
*   **Projection Rebuilds:** Read projections (e.g., search indexes, memory views) can be completely rebuilt from the immutable journal at any time.

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the implementation schedule of these operational capabilities.
